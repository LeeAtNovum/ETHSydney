Topic 1 - Humane way to analyse blockchain data (Dune, bitquery)
Covers dune.xyz (popular stackable dashboard tools, that you can build using a simple query language, or from charts already shared)
Even lazier? transpose got it covered. say “ show me the top 3 transacted tokens on uniswap for today”
Or the classic way: call contract balanceOf()

Topic 2 - Attestations with TokenScript: Let’s make attestations functional!
Attestations are simple signed pieces of data but TokenScript aims to turn them into smart tokens that provide rich functionality straight from the users wallet or other application.
🗣 Speakers: Michael Wallace - Software Engineer from Smart Token Labs🥋📲
